### 🌱 Plant Disease Prediction Model 🌾  
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict plant diseases based on image data and environmental factors. The goal is to provide farmers and agricultural professionals with a tool to detect diseases early, enabling faster intervention and healthier crop yields.  

**🔧 Key Features:**  
- **Image-Based Detection:** Utilizes computer vision techniques to classify plant diseases from leaf images.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Trained on diverse datasets to improve accuracy and generalization.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to be simple and intuitive, making disease detection accessible for non-technical users.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides disease names and potential treatments to guide users.  

**💡 Tech Stack:**  
- Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV)  
- Streamlit for web deployment  
- Dataset sourced from public agricultural repositories  

**🚀 How It Works:**  
1. Upload an image of a plant leaf.  
2. The model processes the image and predicts potential diseases.  
3. Results include confidence scores and suggested treatments.  

**🔍 Future Enhancements:**  
- Real-time mobile app integration  
- Multi-language support  
- Larger and more diverse dataset inclusion
